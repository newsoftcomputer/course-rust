# CARGO

    - Doc: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html

    - Cargo is the Rust package manager. Cargo downloads your Rust package’s dependencies, compiles your packages, makes distributable packages, and uploads them to crates.io, the Rust community’s package registry. You can contribute to this book on GitHub.


## Getting Started

### Instalation

    -The easiest way to get Cargo is to install the current stable release of Rust by using rustup. Installing Rust using rustup will also install cargo.

    On Linux and macOS systems, this is done as follows:

    $ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

    It will download a script, and start the installation. If everything goes well, you’ll see this appear:

    $ Rust is installed now. Great!
