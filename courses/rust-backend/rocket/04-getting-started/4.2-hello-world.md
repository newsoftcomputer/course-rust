# HELLO WORLD

    1. Let's write our first Rocket application! Start by creating a new binary-based Cargo project and changing into the new directory:

        $ cargo new hello-rocket --bin
        
        $ cd hello-rocket


    2. Now, add Rocket as a dependency in your Cargo.toml:

        [dependencies]
        rocket = "0.5.1"


    3. Modify src/main.rs so that it contains the code for the Rocket Hello, world! program, reproduced below:

        #[macro_use] extern crate rocket;

        #[get("/")]
        fn index() -> &'static str {
            "Hello, world!"
        }

        #[launch]
        fn rocket() -> _ {
            rocket::build().mount("/", routes![index])
        }


    4. We won't explain exactly what the program does now; we leave that for the rest of the guide. In short, it creates an index route, mounts the route at the / path, and launches the application. Compile and run the program with cargo run. You should see the following:

        $ cargo run

        > cargo run
